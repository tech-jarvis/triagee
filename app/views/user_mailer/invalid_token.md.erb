Hello @<%= @user.github %>,

Your GitHub token for Code Triage is returning a non-success status. This can happen if you've changed authentication credentials for GitHub or if you revoke API access.

If you intended to revoke access, and don't want to receive any more Code Triage emails please [Delete Your Account](<%= token_delete_user_url(@user.account_delete_token) %>).

If you would like to continue receiving CodeTriage emails, please [Log in](<%= root_url %>) and re-authorize your GitHub token by pressing "sign in" and accepting any GitHub prompts.

If you've believe you've already re-authorized your account but are still getting this email please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/issues) and we can look into it.

Go forth and make the world a better place
