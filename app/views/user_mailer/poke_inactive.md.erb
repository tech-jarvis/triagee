Hello <%= @user.github %>,

You're getting this email because you've signed up for [CodeTriage](<%= root_url %>), but haven't subscribed to any repos yet. Here are some tips for getting started.

### Tips and tricks

- Open source tip: Not sure which repo to select? See the ["Iâ€™m stuck getting started"](<%= university_index_url %>) section of the [CodeTriage University](<%= university_index_url %>).
- Tech tip: Learn about [Real-time Database Events in Postgres with pg_eventserv](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/real-time-database-events-with-pg_eventserv) (via [Postgres Weekly](https://postgresweekly.com/issues/474))
- Tech tip: Learn about [templating in HTML with \<template\>](https://frontendfoc.us/link/129692/web) (via [Frontend focus](https://frontendfoc.us))
- For a comprehensive manual on open source contribution, [check out the "How to Open Source" book](https://howtoopensource.dev/).

### Suggested repos

<% @repos.each do |repo| %>
- **<%= repo.language %>: <%= repo.full_name %>** ([Subscribe](<%= repo_url(repo) %>))
<% end %>

If you don't like any of those [add your own repo](<%= new_repo_url %>) or [browse all repos](<%= root_url %>).

<% if @user.favorite_languages.blank? %>


### Tell us your favorite progrmaming languages

CodeTriage can help you pick a repo. All you have to do is tell us the programming language(s) you most commonly use:

[Select your favorite languages(s)](user_url(@user))


<% end %>


### See you next week

Subscribe to a repo, or you will get this same email next week, maybe with different suggestions. To unsubscribe entirely, [delete your account](<%= user_url(@user) %>), but don't do that, subscribe to a repo and start your open source journey. We believe in you!
